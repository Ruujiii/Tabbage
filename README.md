Tabbage is a Parcel Tracking Service web-based application that allows users to track their parcels in real-time. With Tabbage, users can easily view the current status and location of each package. The application supports three unique account types: "User," "Merchant," and "Driver." Merchants can create parcel tracking numbers, drivers can update the location and cues of existing parcels, and users can query their parcels. Tabbage prioritizes security, optimization, and ease of use, providing a seamless tracking experience.
